#Voice Cloner System
This repository contains the implementation of a Voice Cloner System that leverages deep learning models to generate realistic cloned speech from a given voice sample. The system uses advanced neural network architectures to synthesize natural-sounding speech with the target speakerâ€™s voice characteristics.

#Features
Clone voices with just a few seconds of audio input
Generate high-quality, natural-sounding speech
Easy to run on Google Colab or locally with Python
Supports real-time voice synthesis and experimentation

#Technologies Used
Python
Deep Learning frameworks: PyTorch / TensorFlow (specify your framework)
Pretrained speech synthesis models (e.g., Tacotron2, WaveGlow, etc., or specify your models)
Google Colab support for easy experimentation and testing

#How to Use
Upload or record a sample voice audio
Run the voice cloning pipeline to generate synthetic speech
Adjust parameters as needed to improve quality or style

#Applications
Personalized voice assistants
Audio dubbing and content creation
Accessibility tools for speech-impaired users
Research and experimentation in speech synthesis
